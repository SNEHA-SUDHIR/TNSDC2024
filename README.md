MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognition - Image Classification

DATASET LINK 

Dataset Information
This dataset allows you to study, analyze and recognize elements in the images. That’s exactly how your camera detects your face, using image recognition! It’s a digit recognition problem. This data set has 49,000 images of 28 X 28 size, total of 49 MB.

The data for the model is uploaded in the drive to make the project executable download the Zip file "Train_UQcUa52.zip"
from the folder "TNSDC Files"

# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Handwritten Digit Recognition system powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images using deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset or a similar dataset.
- Achieve high accuracy in digit recognition through advanced CNN architectures and preprocessing techniques.
- Evaluate the trained model using comprehensive metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Test the model on a separate test dataset to assess its real-world performance.
- Optional: Develop a user interface for interacting with the trained model.
- Optional: Deploy the model for use in production environments.
